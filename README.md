## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- !Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I improved my layout skills, and the mobile version is the main one. I used only the necessary tags from HTML5 and checked my work thoroughly with a validator. (Thanks to the community for commenting on my pages, I listen to you) There could be a lot of watered-down explanations that only I need, so I write comments in the code.  



### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
